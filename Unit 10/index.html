<h2>Traveling And You</h2>
<p>Everyone dreams of experiencing new things in fun new places. The world can really grind you down, especailly this year. But, this is your imaginary chance to seize this terrible time and make the most of it. Now is the time to be alive go on your own adventure. Covid may be rampant, but there's always a silver lining! flights are cheaper than they've been in years. Now is the time to get moving, if you aren't afraid of the negative consequences of maybe dying from a very infectious disease. Yeah, maybe requiring us to make a travel website in 2020 was a bad idea...
</p>
<h2>Traveling makes you a better person!</h2>
<p>Getting outside of your bubbles and learning more about other cultures can help a person gain emotional maaturity and empthay. It's easy to believe the stereotypes around us and accept them as truth when we don't have any data to show us otherwise. Traveling is so important becausee it lets people expand their world view and grow. </p>
<p>Life satisfaction tends to go up after a person has traveled more, epecially if that person has traveled to a less wealthy nation. In the documentary "Happy" the narrator discusses the disparity between how much money someone makes and how highly they rate their life satisfaction. It turns out that after you have enough cash to take care of your basic needs like food and water, more money doesn't always lead to a happier life. A lot of the happiest people in the world have very little. Perhaps, that helps them focus on what really matters in life, like relationships.
</p>
<h2>Budgeting Can Be Hard</h2>
    <p>Traveling can seem like a very expensive excursion, but here at Seven Sisters we are gonna help you get the resources you need to spend the least amount of money for the very best value in time available. Particulary, we focus on a full imersion based experience. Take for example our Venice Package. Instead of renting cars, we can help you arrange for a romantic gondala ride and serenade!

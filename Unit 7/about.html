<h1>About</h1>
<h2>Why Did I Make Campus Cooking?</h2>
    
<p>When I first moved away for college, I felt a sense of panic. That was for a lot of reasons, but being an adult, all on your own for the first time is very overwelming. There are a lot of new stresses that fall under that category, but for me, food was a big one. I was lucky to have had a lovely mother all of my life who always made meals for our family. When I moved away, I quickly realized that I needed to figure out how to cook for myself and fast.</p>
<p>As I have learned more about food and the college experience, I feel that I have really come into my own culinary style. I'm really excited to share some of what I have picked up and hopefully make cooking on campus a little bit easier for you! </p>
<p> Now, that's enough chitchat! Let's get you started on your culinary journey. First, you'll need to make sure that you have all of the materials. Click <a href="index.html#tools">here</a> to see a list of equipment!</p>
